I am a second-year master student in the *Statistical Learning Theory* program at [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/msc-programs/ds/slt/) and [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/sltheory/), where I am currently supervised by [Maxim Panov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=BqDhGJQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research interests currently lie within Statistics, Machine learning theory, Optimization and Reinforcement Learning. Recently, I am working on the graph embeddings for Semi-Supervised learning as part of the [Structural Learning Group](http://strlearn.ru/). In addition, lately I have been studying and replicating RL algorithms suggested by novel research papers. For more information, you can access my curriculum vitae [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x34c0T0NlTObxDoVj9QJkagJMhnWXk4P/view?usp=sharing).

This website constitutes a personal experimental mechanism to hierarchically organize my thoughts, thus forcing myself to remain in a creative state of mind by improving my writing skills and developing a constant learning habit.
