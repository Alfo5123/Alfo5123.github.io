Let me briefly share my first impressions after meeting Stephen Wolfram while working as a research programmer at Wolfram Research in Lima, Peru.

> â€”Stephen Wolfram


Perhaps in many of the other computational universes the classical "never meet your heroes" would have fitted perfectly, yet this was an  interesting exception. Around 2005, I was naively  introduced to [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) as an intuitive tool to efficiently ace cumbersome math calculations at school. Although it remained as that for a couple of years, later I started to get intersted on how those calculations were computed so fast and precisely, from an algorithmic point of view. To my surprise, this happened to be a result of several decades of effort based on the idea of using simple principles to compute complex systems: eventually I was fully engaged in a New Kind of Science. 

Stepheh Wolfram, who you perhaps may know from his  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything/transcript?language=en" target="blank">famous TED talk</a> is the genius mind behind it.
