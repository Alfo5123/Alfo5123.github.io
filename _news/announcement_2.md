Let me briefly share my first impressions after meeting Stephen Wolfram while working as a research programmer at Wolfram Research in Lima, Peru.

Perhaps in many of the other computational universes, the classic "never meet your heroes" warning would have fitted perfectly, yet this was a worth telling exception. Around 2005, I was naively  introduced to [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) as an intuitive tool to efficiently ace cumbersome math calculations at school. Although it was only a few years later, that my eager to learn about algorithms kicked off. Suddenly, I was immersed in Mathematica, complex systems and rules.

By odd , after my graduation, I got the opportunity to join the Wolfram Research Team in Lima, Peru.

Stepheh Wolfram, who you perhaps may recognize from his  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything/transcript?language=en" target="blank">famous TED talk</a> is the genius mind behind the company.
