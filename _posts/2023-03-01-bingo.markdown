Contrary to most of the nonsense conversations I have in a daily basis, this one presented a reasonable opportunity to delve into. Nostalgia took me back to 2008-2010 (I know what you are thinking!), during my last years of high school. We had the tradition of playing *BINGO* during the school anniversary festivities. Vividly recall the day when I thought I had won a smaller prize with the "O" pattern: only to realize I had one mistake, unfortunately.

Despite I never won myself the maximum prize (around $2000), attributed to the first player completing the whole board, I witness the excitement of lucky people walking among a big crowd towards the presenter to verify their victory. The following question appeared in my mind, among those memories, how difficult was *actually* to win, afterall? Was it a worthy investment? Was it *actually* easier to win forming the "N" pattern? Ergo, this post.

## Game Description

[TODO]


## Analysis 

Let us define the following variables 
- $$X$$, number of draws so far
- $$\mathcal{F}$$, random event of winning with full cover pattern.
- $$\mathcal{B}$$, random event of winning with "B" pattern.
- $$\mathcal{O}$$, random event of winning with "O" pattern.
- $$\mathcal{N}$$, random event of winning with "N" pattern.

### Full Cover Probability

The cumulative probability of winning with a full cover board in less or equal than $$D$$ draws is,
{: .text-justify}

$$ \mathbb{P}_F ( X \leq D ) = \frac{\binom{51}{D-24}}{\binom{75}{D}} $$

The distribution has support only for values $$D\geq 24$$. Thus, 
{: .text-justify}

$$ \mathbb{P}_F[ X = D ] = \mathbb{P}_F[ X \leq D ] - \mathbb{P}_F[X \leq D-1] $$

$$ \mathbb{P}_F[ X = D ] = \frac{24\binom{51}{D-25}}{ (D-24)\binom{75}{D-1}}  $$

### Pattern Probability

The cumulative probability of winning with a particular pattern $$P$$ in less or equal than $$D$$ draws is given by
{: .text-justify}

$$ \mathbb{P}_P ( X \leq D ) = \sum_{i=P_{size}}^{24} \frac{\binom{24}{i}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}} \times \text{Probability of Forming Pattern P with i marked numbers} $$

In particular, we have for patterns $$\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{O}$$ and $$\mathcal{B} $$ the following expressions,
{: .text-justify}

$$ \mathbb{P}_B ( X \leq D ) = \sum_{i=12}^{24} \frac{\binom{24}{i}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}} \times \frac{\binom{12}{12}\binom{12}{i-12}}{\binom{24}{i}} = \sum_{i=18}^{24} \frac{ \binom{12}{i-12}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}}  $$ 

$$ \mathbb{P}_O ( X \leq D ) = \sum_{i=16}^{24} \frac{\binom{24}{i}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}} \times \frac{\binom{16}{16}\binom{8}{i-16}}{\binom{24}{i}} = \sum_{i=16}^{24} \frac{ \binom{8}{i-16}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}}  $$ 

$$ \mathbb{P}_B ( X \leq D ) = \sum_{i=18}^{24} \frac{\binom{24}{i}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}} \times \frac{\binom{18}{18}\binom{6}{i-18}}{\binom{24}{i}} = \sum_{i=18}^{24} \frac{ \binom{6}{i-18}\binom{51}{D-i}}{\binom{75}{D}}  $$


### Probability Distributions

We can visually inspect how the cumulative distribution probabilities for the different winning cases look like. We can notice that only after $$60$$ draws the chances stop being negligible. This explains why the game lasts that long without winner, even for simpler patterns.   
{: .text-justify}

    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cumulative_dist.png" alt="" title="Cumulative Distribution"/>
</div>

*One interesting observation is how close the probability curves are from each other, defying our initial intuition*. We expected that winning by full cover represented a much slimmer chance than by an $$\mathcal{O}$$ pattern, for instance. Yet, we observe that at $$70$$ draws one has around $$0.15$$ probability of winning by full cover vs. a $$0.3$$ probability of winning by $$\mathcal{O}$$ pattern, if playing in isolation.   
{: .text-justify}

However, in the most realistic BINGO setting we have a huge crowd ($$N\sim 1000$$) so we care about the probability of at least one person winning given $$X$$ draws so far. Thus, we proceed to obtain the cumulative probability distributions of at least one person winning for each pattern.
{: .text-justify}

 If the probability of an event happening is $$p$$, then the probability that it will happen at least once in $$N$$ times is $$ 1 - (1-p)^N $$. Using this formula, we obtained the following results,
{: .text-justify}

    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cumulative_dist_1000.png" alt="" title="Cumulative Distribution - 1000 players"/>
</div>

*The updated results match our intuition: where each cumulative probability curve is drastically spread after $$\sim 40$$ draws.* From these distributions we can calculate the expected value of draws required to win for each case.
{: .text-justify}

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Pattern      | Expected Draws To Win - 1 player | Expected Draws To Win - 1k players | 
| :----:       |    :----:   |    :----: |
| Full Cover      | 72.96       | 58.79       |
| B   | 72.00        | 53.16      |
| O   | 71.52        | 50.56       |
| N   | 70.15        | 43.56       |


Finally, this analysis leads to another open question for the curious reader: **what would be the 'optimal' way of assigning the prize's values given our probabilistic findings?** 

I am confident that my high school's organizers did not think this through or did the math. Since  $$\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{O}$$ and even $$\mathcal{B}$$ were given kitchen appliances or TVs as prizes, while full cover win was rewarded with the highest prize of 2000 dollars, for a 3 dollar priced BINGO board.
