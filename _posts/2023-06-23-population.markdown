Recently I  came across the following quantitative question:

>A mythical city contains $$100,000$$ married couples but no children. Each family wishes to "continue the male line", but they do not wish to overpopulate. So, each family has one baby per annum until the arrival of the first boy. For example, if (at some future date) a family has five children, then it must be either that they are all girls, and another child is planned, or that there are four girls and one boy, and no more children are planned. Assume that the children are equally likely to be born male or female. 
Let $$p(t)$$ be the percentage of **children** that are male at the end of year $$t$$.  How is this percentage expected to evolve through time?

At this point, the ambitious reader should not avoid spoilers and take a few minutes to try to solve it without using a piece of paper for calculations (ideally).
