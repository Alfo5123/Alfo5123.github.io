In an unxpected turn of events, returning from a trip to Yellowstone, I found in my phone the book ["Principles and Techniques in Combinatorics"](https://www.isinj.com/mt-usamo/Principles%20and%20Techniques%20in%20Combinatorics%20-%20Chen%20Chuan-Chong,%20Koh%20Khee-Meng%20(WS,%201992).pdf). Being a passionate about combinatorics I decided to give it a try. Only a few pages later, I was totally engaged with the material. I do plan to continue reading the following chapters in the upcoming months. However, at least for now, let me share some of the problems from the book that grabbed my attention and present as well the solutions I came up with.

#### Problem 1
Prove that it is impossible for seven distinct straight lines to be situated in the Euclidean plane so as to have at least six points where exactly three of these lines intersect and at least four points where exactly two of these lines intersect. (*Putnam, 1973*).

#### Problem 2
Let $$S=\{1, 2, \cdots, 1990\}$$. A 31-element subset $$A$$ of $$S$$ is said to be *good* if the sum $$\sum_{a\in A} a$$ is divisible by 5. Find the number of 31-element subsets of $$S$$ which are good. (*Proposed by the Indian team at the 31st IMO*).

#### Problem 3
For $$\{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$$ and each of its nonempty subsets, a unique *alternating sum* is defined as follows: Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternatively add and substract successive numbers. (For example, the alternating sum for $$\{1, 2, 4, 6, 9\}$$ is $$9-6+4-2+1=6$$ and for $$\{5\}$$ is simply 5.) Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $$n=7$$. (*AIME, 1983/13*)
