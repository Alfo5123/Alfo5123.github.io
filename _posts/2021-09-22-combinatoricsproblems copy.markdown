Unlike many of the unsuccessful internet searches, two months ago I came across the [professional website](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~tauraso/) of Professor Roberto Tauraso from the Mathematics Department of the Universit√† di Roma. He dedicated one [section of his website](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~tauraso/AMM/amm.html) to solve and share the American Monthly Mathematical Problems, which are part of [The American Mathematical Monthly](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly). To be honest, I was not familiar with this journal, however I decided to give it a try and attempt a few problems.

I have always been a fan of such math problems that push you to find interesting approaches and learn new obscure theorems in order to derive a solution. The problems I found were precisely like that. I must admit some of them took me several days and a few cups of coffee, yet I take pride to say I was not totally lost, after all. These are the problems I have solved so far (will add more as time goes on). I would invite the readers to take them as sporadic challenges.

### Problem 12260
Prove

$$ \int_{0}^\infty \frac{\sin^2(x) - x \sin(x)}{x^3} dx = \frac12 - \log2 $$

*Proposed by S. M. Stewart (Australia), American Mathematical Monthly, Vol.128, 2021*

### Problem 12265
For a fixed positive integer $$k$$, let $$a_0 = a_1 = 1$$ and $$a_n = a_{n-1} + (k-n)^2 a_{n-2}$$ for $$n \geq 2$$. Show that $$a_k = (k-1)!$$. 
*Proposed by R. Dempsey (USA), American Mathematical Monthly, Vol.128, 2021*


### Problem 12276
Prove 

$$ I = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} \frac{1}{2^{i-1}(i-1)!(n-2i)!} = 1 $$

*Proposed by Joe Santmyer, Las Cruces, NM., Vol 128, Issue 8, American Mathematical Monthly, 2021.*

### Problem 12287
Prove 

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( n \left( \sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \right)^2  - \frac{1}{n} \right) = \frac12\left( 3 - \zeta(2) + 3\zeta(3) \right) $$

*Proposed by - O. Furdui and A. Sintamarian (Romania), Vol 128, American Mathematical Monthly 2021*.


**More solutions will be available after the deadline.**


One of the main intentions of this post is to thank Professor Tauraso for sharing knowledge, motivating with his work, and freely exchanging ideas with students across the internet. If someday I visit Rome again, I will definitely pass by your office to meet you. Until then, *Grazie mille!*  :)
